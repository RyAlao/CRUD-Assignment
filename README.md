Hello!
This is my simple Task managment application, using Spring boot angular js backend and html, css, js front end. I have redone everything. I was able to fix the issue of my delete button not working after doing some troubleshooting in my backend. There was an issue with the IDs being assigned to each task. Once I corrected this I was able to call my Get. Post, Put, and Delete methods with no issue. The app is running fine now and I have also added some simple styling and layout changes to make the app more appealing to the eye.
